Project 1

In this folder you'll find the sample receiver, code for computing and
validating checksums, as well as a simple interactive sender. 

Receiver.py is the sample receiver. What you've received is largely identical
to what we will use for grading your projects (what we actually use may include
additional instrumentation to assist in grading, but should not vary
significantly in functionality). Feel free to modify it, but keep in mind that
we will be testing against our own version of the sender, not yours (except, of
course, if you're implementing an extra credit option that requires extending
the receiver we provided). If bugs are found or changes made to the sample
receiver, we'll notify you and post an update copy. Additionally, the latest
version of the sample receiver will usually be running on FOO.cs.berkeley.edu,
port 33122, and you are welcome to test your senders against that receiver.

Checksum.py includes two functions for validating and generating checksums for
your packets:

    validate_checksum(message): Returns true if the message's checksum matches
        the message, and false otherwise. This function assumes the last field
        of the message the checksum.

    generate_checksum(message): Returns the checksum string for a message. This
        function assumes the message includes the trailing delimiter. The
        checksum is ONLY valid if you simply append this function's result to
        the message you pass in.

Sender.py is the simple interactive sender. It will send any message you type
in to the sender hard-coded into the program over a UDP packet. It then waits
for a response before prompting you for a new message. Feel free to build upon
this simple sender for your own sender.
